# Our App: Eat something


A hosted version of this app can be found on heroku at [eat-something1.heroku.com] (https://eat-something1.herokuapp.com)

### Application Overview

An app that suggests recipes to parents of fussy eaters, based on two choices; 1 ingredient that their child likes to eat, and 1 ingredient that the parents want them to eat. This was a group project with one other developer.

### Instructions

1. The Eat Something homepage displays an image and a navbar, and takes you through to choose your ingredients page via a button. There are also options to register and log in via the navbar links.

2. Once on the ingredients index page, a user can select two ingredients, and then submit their choices. This will redirect them to the recipe show page.

3. Once on the recipe show page, the user can see information on the chosen recipe, which combines both chosen ingredients. There is an image, nutrition information on both ingredients, the other ingredients needed, and the method. There is also an option to comment on the recipe in a comments form, and these comments are displayed at the bottom of the page in the comments feed.

4. Users can register from the Register page and login on the login page. Users must provide a unique email address and matching password/password confirmation.

5. Once logged in, users are redirected back to the homepage. There will now be an option to visit their profile page in the navbar.

6. Once on their profile page users can see their avatar, details, message form, and their inbox. Here the user has the option to send a message to another user, by selecting that user from the dropdown menu. These messages will show up in the inbox of that other users profile page.

## Process

This was a project with one other developer, [Gessica Santoro](https://github.com/Gessy90). We used Trello to manage the project and performed daily standups. Features were created on separate git branches before being merged into the development branch.

We started the project by planning our models and database structure.
